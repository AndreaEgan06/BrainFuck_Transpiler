# README

This is my solution to a problem on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f9cad032b8b91e12000035) which I started working on at some point in 2024 when I was a high school senior.

I abandoned this project at some point for reasons I can't remember.
Now that I'm doing a CS BS degree at RIT, I've decided to come back to this project.
I've always looked back fondly at my time working on this so much so that it inspired to RIT's CSCI-742 Compiler Construction course this semester.
Looking back, this was a good introduction to compiling at the time, and taking the class has inspired me to come back and finish this project.

## The BrainFuck Interpreter

To help me test my generated transpiled BrainFuck (BF) code I made my own BF interpreter when I originally picked up this project.
It was not very accurate to the description of the interpreter that the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f9cad032b8b91e12000035) problem stated.
The one cool feature I had built into it was that I could set a breakpoint in the BF code after which it would visually display the code and the BF tape and let me step through the execution of the code.
